Hi! My name is Gaetano Scaduto, I am 26 years old and this is my personal website.

I am currently a PhD Student researching in social science. I use my professional skills to study society and politics through **quantitative** and **computational** methods, while also having rigorous training in qualitative methods.

I have also worked in **political marketing**, contributing to multiple national electoral campaigns in Italy.

I am currently **open for work**, and I am particularly interested in positions involving **survey research**. If you want to discuss job opportunities, please get in touch at gaetanoscaduto1999\@gmail.com

In this site you can find my CV, bio, publications, teaching materials, and other random stuff I decided to put here ;)

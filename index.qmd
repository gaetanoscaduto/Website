-   Hi! My name is Gaetano Scaduto and this is my personal website.

-   I am a PhD Student at the University of Milan-Bicocca. I am researching in the fields of political communication, political psychology, election studies, and related.

-   In this site you can find information about myself and my work, materials and code I produced for teaching and presentations, academic and non-academic articles, and other random stuff I decide to put here.

Hi! My name is Gaetano Scaduto and this is my personal website.

I am currently a PhD Student researching in the field of political communication. I use my professional skills to study society and politics through **quantitative** and **computational** methods.

I have also worked in **political marketing**, contributing to multiple national electoral campaigns in Italy.

I am currently **open for work**, and I am particularly interested in positions involving **survey research, data analysis**, and/or **political marketing**. If you want to discuss job oportunities, please get in touch on gaetanoscaduto1999\@gmail.com

Hi! My name is Gaetano Scaduto, I am 26 years old, I come from Sicily, and I live in Antwerp (Belgium).

I am currently a PhD Student researching in social science. I use my professional skills to study society and politics through **quantitative** and **computational** methods, while also having rigorous training in qualitative methods. I have also worked in **political marketing**, contributing to multiple national electoral campaigns in Italy.

From October 2025, I will join the **Erasmus Institute on Culture and Stratification** at the **Erasmus University of Rotterdam** for a postdoc position on a project on climate change perceptions.

In this site you can find my CV, bio, publications, teaching materials, and other random stuff I decided to put here ;)

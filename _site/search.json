Therefore, here I share some of the works of art I am more enthusiastic about. Because I think these things tell about me as much as (maybe more) any research I have done so far. Researching is fun, and teaching is so much fun, but neither gives you goosebumps. So here in what follows a selection of my favorite musical albums, movies, TV shows, and the like."

    "text": "A selection of my favorite musical albums\n\nGlamour by I Cani\n\nI Cani are the milestone of the 2010 indie music scene in Italy, of which I have been a hardcore fan in my high school years. They published three albums. Glamour, the middle one, is my personal favorite (but the race is close). This album makes me cry and hope for a better future, and never in more than 10 years have bored me.\nFavorite track: Come Vera Nabokov\n\n\nNon al Denaro, Non all’Amore, Né al Cielo by Fabrizio De André\n\nI have declared my love for this album by dedicating my high school final thesis to it. I basically analyze the whole text of the album. Because it is pure poetry in every track. It is the musical transposition of Edgar Lee Masters’ Spoon River Anthology, and I just think it may be the greatest piece of Italian music of all time. Some lines here get under my skin as it was the first time.\nFavorite track: “Un malato di cuore”\n\n\nDisintegration by The Cure\n\nToo much Italian music so far. So we go to the real classic. The Cure is a band so powerful that I love them but never listen to them. Because it’s too much. I listen to them only during a break-up (to worsen things). Yet, they are with me most of the time. Around once a year I listen to “Pictures of You” and feel renewed. I force myself not to listen to that song more because I want that song to feel fresh every time I listen to it. I want to forget something about it and epiphany back to it again.\nFavorite track: Pictures of You\n\n\nMi Fist by Club Dogo\n\nThe album that changed Italian hip-hop forever, and my life with it. An album that spits rage and revolution, political to its core, strong and angry. An album that speaks about injustice and that reminds me where the fire comes from.\nFavorite : Cronache di resistenza\n\n\nBorn to Die by Lana Del Rey\n\nLana Del Rey is usually associated either with the Republican Right or the LGBTQ community (maybe more with the G). I think Lana is universal and Born To Die is her masterpiece. An album that encloses hip-hop sounds, one of the greatest voices of our times, and the theme of losing a loved one. I know I lose points in the heads of the critics here. I do not care.\nFavorite track: Summertime Sadness\n\n\nElio Samaga Hukapan Kariyana Turu by Elio e le Storie Tese\n\nThis is THE milestone in Italian comedy prog rock (“rock demenziale”). The immortal masterpiece of a band so good that always makes me sing and laugh to the tears. I have one specific sentence in one of the songs contained in this album that I swear to tattoo on my body at some point.\nFavorite Track: John Holmes (Una vita per il cinema)"

    "text": "Last updated: April 2024\nI was born on February 25th, 1999 in Agrigento, a small city in Sicily. The very same night, Fabio Fazio interviewed Mikhail Gorbachev at the Festival di Sanremo. I was destined for studying the relationship between politics and culture!\n\n\n\nThe Concordia Temple, the most famous landmark in my hometown (also a UNESCO world heritage site)\n\n\nWhen I was a little boy, I wanted to be a comedian. Since then, I changed my mind hundreds of times about what I wanted to be as a grown-up.\nI attended the “Empedocle” classical high school in Agrigento, wanting to be a writer or something like that. But I quickly got bored and decided to change my path. At the age of 18, I moved to Turin, where I have a Bachelor in Mathematics for Engineering with full grades at the Polytechnic of Turin.\n\n\n\nThe city of Turin, which adopted me during my university years\n\n\nBut then I got bored of doing maths for maths’ sake. I enrolled in a Master’s degree in Political and Public Communication at the University of Turin where I graduated in 2022. At that point, I felt like I found my true passion: studying politics and society through quantitative methods.\nI am currently enrolled in the PhD program of Analysis of Social and Economic Processes (ASEP) at the University of Milan-Biccocca. I am working in the fields of political sociology and political psychology. I am currently on a research stay in Antwerp (BE), working with the “Media, Movement, and Politics (M2P)” research group, a wonderful bunch of people who welcomed me warmly and created an incredibly stimulating environment to do research.\n\n\n\nThe entrance to the Antwerp train station, one of its most famous landmarks\n\n\nThrough the years I have also worked outside academia, in the political communication and marketing fields, managing social media pages and media relations for political organizations and working for electoral campaigns as deputy campaign coordinator and junior researcher for Social Changes, Inc. during the Italian general political elections of September 2022 and the elections for city council in June 2022.\nIn my free time I still love writing. When I was a teenager I used to take part in role-plays based on writing. I have a blog where I write about politics, but I cannot really be consistent with it.\nI also love biking, and listening to music of every genre. My all-time favorites? The Cure, Fabrizio De André, Club Dogo and Elio e le Storie Tese. My favorite directors are Paolo Sorrentino and Wes Anderson (but I swear I am not that kind of hipster). My favorite TV show is probably Scrubs because it’s the only comedy show that I still find amusing after 20 years from its release. I am a huge fan of stand-up comedy, both Italian and American. Jim Jefferies and Mike Birbiglia are my personal GOATs."

    "text": "I still ask myself if this picture really makes sense\n\n\nDuring my university years, I often used to go to the university canteen to eat, being both poor and too lazy to cook.\nI used to live in Turin (the most beautiful city in the world, in case you didn’t know it). First I studied at the Polytechnic University of Turin (PoliTo), and then at the University of Turin (UniTo).\nThe two universities are pretty far from each other and have different canteens. Yet, both canteens were handled by the same distributor, so the food provided to one was the same provided to the other. At the same time, every canteen seemed to have a lot of freedom in choosing what they could serve to the students.\n\n\n\nUnrelated image\n\n\nI am an omnivore, yet I always kind of suffered from the short list of vegetarian options (and the complete lack of vegan options) that I found at the canteen near the PoliTo. When I started going to UniTo, I noticed that the canteen there ALWAYS had at least one VEGAN option. From Monday to Saturday (it was closed on Sunday) there was always something different, either lentils burgers, tofu, seitan, or something else that was prepared with a certain amount of care.\nI started asking myself why was that.\nI had always perceived the PoliTo as a kind-of-right-wing university. STEM culture in Italy is usually linked to the center and center-right. The reasons can be many, but they may reside in the fact that people who tend to choose these faculties may value as more important the amount of money they will make from their future jobs. We could discuss these reasons another time.\n\n\n\nOn the left: classic UniTo haircuts; On the right: classic PoliTo haircuts\n\n\nI did not have at the time, and still don’t, any data to prove that PoliTo students are more right-wing than UniTo students. Yet, my perception of them being more right was consistent with the lack of attention that, in the canteen near the PoliTo, was reserved for vegans and vegetarians; a population that, you can believe me on my word, is likely to be considered as more left-wing than most.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, read my paper titled “Food for (Political) Thought” (in review, while I am writing).\n\nAt the same time, UniTo was, in my mind, left-wing heaven. Especially in the social-science-dominated Campus Einaudi (the most beautiful university campus in the world, in case you didn’t know it), being a leftie was the assumed condition for everyone, and people who were not lefties were spotted and glanced with adversarial intent by most of their colleagues. Again, I do not have any data to confirm that (although one could look at the University elections and see that, while in PoliTO there were no successful extreme-left university parties, in UniTo there were at least - like - three. When I asked myself why the canteens were so different in terms of their menu, I gave myself the following response: “Probably the lefties in UniTo elected a student representative that wanted to push the availability of vegan options in the canteen, to promote environmentally friendly agenda that winked at their left-wing constituency”.\nAt that time, I was preparing my PhD proposal. One day, I went to my mentor and told him something like:\nG: “Ehy! I have an idea about my PhD proposal”\nM: “Shoot”\nG: “I want to explain why in UniTo everyone is a leftie and in PoliTo everyone is a righty”\n\n\n\nOnly for (left-wing) Italians\n\n\nM readily understood that I was going toward a gigantic stream of literature, that would have consumed my life from then on. But I always loved this stuff, and I was ready to go down the rabbit hole. For a year or so, I read papers on the alignment regarding lifestyle and political preferences. Why do lefties prefer hip-hop, modern art, vegan food, and Birkenstocks, and why do righties prefer classical music, old and sacred art, meat, and white shirts?\nAfter a year or so, I was talking with a PhD colleague of mine, who, incidentally, used to be a student representative - responsible for the canteen - at UniTo, and I told her my story about the canteen. And here, she freaking changed my word. She told me that no one among the student representatives ever pushed for the canteen menu to be more vegan.\nNow, I do not know if she was fully aware or if she was just assuming, but that completely changed my perspective.\nIf no student ever pushed for having a more vegan menu at UniTo’s canteen, it meant that it was something that came from inside the canteen itself. Maybe some very vegan person worked there completely by chance and pushed for a more vegan-friendly menu. Or maybe, just maybe, they expected, by virtue of their own stereotypes, that UniTo students would indeed appreciate the Vegan menu more than PoliTo students, and therefore act accordingly.\n\n\n\nA scene from an old Italian movie. The caption says: “Mortadella is communist, salami is socialist, prosciutto is a Christian democrat, […] and ham is a fascist.\n\n\nWhat a freaking game changer: the knowledge (or even the presumed knowledge) of the political preferences of the student body were translated into assumed lifestyle preferences, and our reality (more precisely, my lunch) was bent according to this perception.\nI thought this was enough to choose to dedicate my entire career to this: shedding light of the political inferences from apolitical cues, the apolitical inferences from political cues, and political stereotypes, and political compasses, and political caricatures, their consequences, causes, related aspects, so on and so forth."

Here you can find the teaching materials that I produced so far.

-   A brief and smooth [Introduction to R](https://github.com/gaetanoscaduto/Laboratorio-R) course (in Italian).

<!-- -->

-   In autumn 2023 I held two classes with students from the BA in Organization Sciences at the University of Milan-Bicocca.

    -   A practical introduction to the statistical software R for the analysis of electoral data.

        -   Teaching material is available [here](https://github.com/gaetanoscaduto/teaching/tree/main/introduzioneR).

    -   A class on the problems with collective decision-making: Condorcet's paradox, strategic misreporting, and Arrow's theorem.

        -   You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/gaetanoscaduto/teaching/tree/main/CondorcetPP).

-   In spring 2023, I held two classes with students from the BA in Organization Sciences at the University of Milan-Bicocca.

    -   In one, I presented the research on **political polarization** and the state of the art regarding research on political inferences from apolitical cues.

        -   You can download the slides [here](teaching_materials/Polarizzazione.pdf).

    -   In the other, I presented the students an introduction to linear regression.

        -   You can download the material I produced (a medium-length document presenting the general topic) [here](teaching_materials/Dispensa_regressione.pdf).

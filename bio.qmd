I was born on February 25th, 1999 in Agrigento, a small city in Sicily*.* The very same night, [Fabio Fazio interviewed Mikhail Gorbachev at the Festival di Sanremo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZh8m3KygBY). I was destined for studying the relationship between politics and culture!

When I was a little boy, I wanted to be a comedian. Since then, I changed my mind hundreds of times about what I wanted to be as a grown-up.

I attended the "Empedocle" classical high school in Agrigento, wanting to be a writer or something like that. But I quickly got bored and decided to change my path. At the age of 18, I moved to Turin, where I have a Bachelor in **Mathematics for Engineering** with full grades at the Polytechnic of Turin.

But then I got bored of doing maths for maths' sake. I enrolled in a Master's degree in **Political and Public Communication** at the University of Turin where I graduated in 2022. At that point, I felt like I found my true passion: studying politics and society through quantitative methods.

I am currently enrolled in the PhD program of **Analysis of Social and Economic Processes** (ASEP) at the University of Milan-Biccocca. I am working in the fields of political sociology and political psychology. I am currently on a research stay in Antwerp (BE), working with the "[Media, Movement, and Politics (M2P)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/m2p/)" research group, a wonderful bunch of people who welcomed me warmly and created an incredibly stimulating environment to do research.

Through the years I have also worked outside academia, in the **political communication and marketing** fields, managing social media pages and media relations for political organizations and working for electoral campaigns as deputy campaign coordinator and junior researcher for [Social Changes, Inc](https://www.social-changes.com/). during the Italian general political elections of September 2022 and the elections for city council in June 2022.

In my free time I still love **writing**. I also love **biking**, and listening to music of every genre. My all-time favorites? The Cure, Fabrizio De Andr√©, Club Dogo and Elio e le Storie Tese. My favorite directors are Paolo Sorrentino and Wes Anderson (but I swear I am not *that* kind of hipster). My favorite TV show is probably Scrubs because it's the only comedy show that I still find amusing after 20 years from its release. I am a huge fan of stand-up comedy.
